# sales-data-analysis
This is a project that I practiced EDA and visualization skills in Python using sales data to answer some potential business problems.

The idea and data are originally from Keith Galli. You can his code at https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks and his tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t
